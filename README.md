# Apparatus Criticus

I'm still waiting on a better name. This is the open source rewrite of [Apparatus Explorer](https://www.apparatusexplorer.com/).

At this stage I am merely creating the basic data models.

This new version is more than an explorer. Its features will include
- visualization
- editing
- publishing
- analysis tools
- CBGM via `open-cbgm`
- and as many modules from [Criticus](https://github.com/d-flood/criticus/) as make sense to bring to a web app.
