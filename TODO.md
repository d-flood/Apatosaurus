# TO DO

- Support more sophisticated TEI import and export formats as [Joey McCollum demonstrates](https://jjmccollum.github.io/teiphy/advanced.html#analysis-at-varying-levels-of-detail-using-reading-types).

## Priority

- set up litestream
    - done... BUT this application probably needs a full Postgres database.
- write "About"
