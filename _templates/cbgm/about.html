    <p>
        For the first time, a public platform and user interface for an implementation of 
        the Coherence-Based Genealogical Method (CBGM) is available to users for use with 
        their own collation data.
    </p>
    <h3>The CBGM</h3>
    <p>
        The CBGM is a set of tools for the analysis of the relationships between textual witnesses. 
        Gerd Mink created and implemented the first versions of the CBGM in association with 
        <a href="http://egora.uni-muenster.de/intf/index_en.shtml">INTF</a>. It is highly recommended
        that users of Apatosaurus familiarize themselves with the CBGM in general before attempting to
        use the modules provided here.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two aspects to learning about the CBGM:
        <ol>
            <li>Key concepts and terms, e.g. "coherence," "contamination," "witness," etc.</li>
            <li>The mechanics of <em>using</em> a specific implementation of the CBGM.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        For an introduction to the key concepts and terms, David Flood recommends the following resources:

                    This book offers a good introductory explanation of the theory of the 
                    CBGM as originally invented by Gerd Mink. Some of the implementation-specific details are now
                    out of date, however the theoretical discussions and examples are still very helpful.

    <h3>The <code>open-cbgm</code></h3>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7317855">open-cbgm</a> is an open-source 
        implementation of the CBGM developed by Joey McCollum. He has released the open-cbgm as both a 
        <a href="https://github.com/jjmccollum/open-cbgm">class library</a> and as a
        <a href="https://github.com/jjmccollum/open-cbgm-standalone">standalone command line application</a>.
        It is only because of this superb software and generous permissions that Apatosaurus is able to 
        offer the tools of the CBGM to users. For more information about the open-cbgm, see the pages
        for the class library and standalone versions linked above.
    </p>
    <h3>The <code>open-cbgm</code> in Apatosaurus</h3>
    <p>
        Apatosaurus provides a user-friendly interface to the <code>open-cbgm</code>.
        The interface provided here offers the same flexibility and power of the command line
        application while easing the transition from collation creation to analysis of that collation
        via the CBGM. Apatosaurus includes the <code>open-cbgm</code> in accordance with the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjmccollum/open-cbgm/master/LICENSE">MIT license</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>open-cbgm</code> takes a TEI collation file as input. The advantage that Apatosaurus has is
        that collations are stored in the database and can be reliably exported in a TEI format that 
        the <code>open-cbgm</code> accepts. Therefore, this conversion is invisible to the user since Apatosaurus 
        handles it in the background.
    </p>
    <h3>Citing the <code>open-cbgm</code></h3>
    <p>
        Whether you use the <code>open-cbgm</code> via Apatosaurus, or the command line version,
        please use the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7317855">DOI for citation purposes</a>. Details for citing Apatosaurus 
        are forthcoming.
