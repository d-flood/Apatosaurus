<h3>New Collation</h3>
<p>
    To start a new collation, simply assign it a name and number below. 
    The number is for sorting and in case you would like to use the IGNTP reference designations, 
    e.g., "B06K11V1", which indicates the first verse of the 11th chapter of the 6th book of the New Testament.
