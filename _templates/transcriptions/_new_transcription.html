            Add a new transcription by naming it and providing the plain text of the transcription. 
            Once you have added the transcription, you can then add normalized values for any of the words.
            Note that you should not (yet) use Apatosaurus for transcription. Transcriptions should merely
            be pasted in for the purpose of automated collation. If you have a TEI encoded transcription
            created in association with the IGNTP or INTF, then please use "Import TEI Transcription" instead.
